## Instructions
1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
2. Open up the `index.html` page in your browser.
  - Optional: Use the `Live Server` Extension for VS Code to auto-update the page when you make changes
3. Create some CSS rules to style the index.html page. SOme recomendations of changes are supplied below, but feel free to make it your own.
4. Be sure to add and commit your changes using git as you go.

## Changes
Here are some ideas for changes to make to the page. You should be able to achieve all of these without editing the `index.html` file.

- Give our main header a cooler font and make it larger.
- Get rid of the bullet points next to our navigation links.
- Change the color of our navigation Links
- Have the navigation links change color when our pointer is over them
- Add some padding to our web page (We don't want content right against the edge)
- Give each article a border with rounded corners
- Give our article titles an underline.
- Make the "Article Title" and "Author and Date" closer together.
- Make our author photos smaller and round.
- Make our footer text smaller.
